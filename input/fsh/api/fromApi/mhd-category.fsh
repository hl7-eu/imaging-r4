// EHDS Regulation defined priority document categories for cross-border primary use

Title:      "EHDS Access: EEHRxF Document Priority Category CodeSystem"
Description: """
CodeSystem for priority document categories in EEHRxF as the document categories as defined in the EHDS regulation.

The codes defined here are directly linked to the Priority Categories defined in the EHDS regulation. The meaning of these codes is directly linked to the meaning given to the concepts in the EHDS regulation.

The EHDS Regulation initially defines six priority categories of electronic health data that all Member States must support first for cross-border primary use. These categories are explicitly listed in [Article 14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj#d1e2289-1-1) of Regulation (EU) 2025/327.

[Article 105](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj#d1e6862-1-1) specifies the date when support for these priority categories is required: 26 March 2029 for categories (a), (b) and (c); 28 March 2031 for (d), (e) and (f).

EHDS empowers the EU Commission to make changes to the list of priority categories at any point in time by means of a Delegated Act (Article 14(2)). There will be a minimum 1-year lead time between the decision to add a new priority category and the initial date when support ahs to be implemented.

The definitions of the priority categories comes from [ANNEX I](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32025R0327#annex-I) of the EHDS Regulation.

Title:      "EHDS Access:EEHRxF Document Type ValueSet"
Description: """
Document type codes for clinical precision in document identification.

This ValueSet contains LOINC codes for specific document types used in
DocumentReference.type. Unlike category (coarse search), type provides
clinical precision for identifying exact document kinds.

**Usage Pattern**:
- type is primarily used for client-side filtering after a broad category search
- type MAY be used as a search parameter when the specific document type is known
- Multiple type codes may apply to a single document (e.g., a discharge summary
  that is also a patient summary)

**MVP Document Types** (Priority Categories):
- Patient Summary (IPS)
- Discharge Summary (HDR)
- Laboratory Report
- Diagnostic Imaging Report

Note: This list will expand as additional priority categories are implemented.

JFM: This ValueSet should be made up of other ValueSets, with each of them assigned to one of the priority categories. Thus it is clear what document types are within each category. Is this the place to find all of them? https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/HEU/pages/358255737/Implementation+Guides
